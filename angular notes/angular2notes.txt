Angular II / IV notes

------------------------------------------------------------------
built in directives

*ngIf --  else capabilities  

[ngStyle] = "{backgroundColor: getColor()}" - [ ] for property binding, expects java script and can call a method   -- this will assign a style

[ngClass] = "{online: serverStatus === 'online'}"  [] for property binding, expects js obj  --this will assign a class dynamically

*ngFor -- *ngFor = "let logItem of log; let i = index" to get the index




-----------------------------------------------------------
deployment

build app for production - minify and ahead of time copilation (find documentation)

base element - make sure set correctly.  need to change to particular path for ex...   /teddyFood vs basehref='/'  (this may be possible to do in the build process)

assure server returns correct start page 

configure server to return angular home page for 404 errors

dist folder has what needs to be deployed
